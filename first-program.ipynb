    "To start writing our Python program, we'll have to open up a new file in a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use any text editor (e.g. VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) or Python IDE (e.g. PyCharm) that you're comfortable with.\n",
    "And while it's completely not necessary for Python to have a full-fledged IDE, it can be quite a help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is very strict with whitespaces and indentation as these are used to delineate sections of our program.\n",
    "In fact, random indentations in the source code is an error---they mean something!\n",
    "As such, if you can, set your text editor to interpret pressing the `<Tab>` key as inserting 4 spaces instead of an actual `<Tab>` character. \n",
    "We don't want to accidently mix in `<Tab>`s and `<Space>`s in our source file later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, write our little program. \n",

Make sure you run the command on the same directory the file `hello.py` is in. If python is installed correctly and if there are no errors in your program, you should see the following output:\n",
